## Introduction

Welcome to the **Enhanced World Simulation**, a groundbreaking, AI-driven simulation environment. This program models a dynamic world populated by entities that exhibit realistic behaviors, evolve through reinforcement learning, and interact with a robust environment governed by complex rules. Combining the power of **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** and **MPI (Message Passing Interface)**, this project simulates societal growth, resource management, and emergent behaviors at an unprecedented scale.

### Key Objectives:
- Simulate a dynamic, evolving world with AI-powered decision-making.
- Understand emergent behaviors in a society driven by resource constraints and collective knowledge.
- Provide a scalable simulation framework using MPI for parallel processing.

## Features

### AI-Powered Entities
- **Roles and Capabilities:** Entities dynamically adapt their roles, such as Strategists, Engineers, Scientists, and Leaders, based on their states and the environment.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Utilize DQN for decision-making, enabling entities to optimize their actions for long-term success.

### Realistic World Dynamics
- **Resource Management:** Entities manage finite resources like food, gold, and influence to sustain themselves and advance their goals.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Global knowledge evolves as entities explore, experiment, and teach.
- **Emergent Behavior:** Watch as societies grow, alliances form, and conflicts arise organically.

### Infrastructure and Growth
- **Building and Upgrades:** Develop infrastructure such as transportation systems, utilities, and social services.
- **Space Exploration:** Initiate space flights to expand the simulation beyond terrestrial boundaries.
- **Societal Structures:** Establish homes, found towns, and manage complex societal hierarchies.

- **Entity Class:** Represents autonomous agents with individual attributes and behaviors.
- **ActionModel (DQN):** Neural networks predict optimal actions based on states.
- **Replay Buffer:** Stores experiences to enhance DQN training.
- **MPI Integration:** Parallelizes the simulation for efficient scalability.
- **Event Logger:** Tracks significant events for analysis and debugging.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **MPI Implementation:** Install [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) or [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/).
- **Git:** For version control.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EnhancedWorldSimulation.git
cd EnhancedWorldSimulation
```

### Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, you can install the necessary packages manually:

```bash
pip install mpi4py torch numpy
```

## Usage

### Running the Simulation

Execute the simulation using MPI:

```bash
mpirun --hostfile mpi_hosts -np 24 python3 GameSim50.py
```

- `--hostfile mpi_hosts`: File listing node IPs or hostnames.
- `-np 24`: Number of parallel processes.
