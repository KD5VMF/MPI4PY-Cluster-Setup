# World_Simulator10 - Realistic Life Progression Simulation

Welcome to **World_Simulator10**, a distributed, MPI-powered simulation that realistically models the progression of entities through various life stages. This enhanced version ensures entities develop through survival, civilization-building, industrialization, and modern eras before advancing to space exploration.

## **üèóÔ∏è Key Components**

### **1. Life Progression Stages**
1. **Basic Survival:**
   - Gathering food, water, and basic resources.
   - Building shelters and forming small communities.

2. **Early Civilization:**
   - Establishing towns and villages.
   - Learning farming, crafting, and basic trade.

3. **Technological Expansion:**
   - Constructing roads, schools, and hospitals.
   - Harnessing electric power and steam engines.

4. **Industrial Age:**
   - Developing transportation (trains, planes, cars).
   - Creating advanced infrastructure (factories, cities).

5. **Modern Era:**
   - Establishing governments, law enforcement, and public services.
   - Advancing in medicine, information technology, and global connectivity.

6. **Space Age:**
   - Researching space technology and AI.
   - Establishing space programs and advanced facilities.

### **2. MPI Distributed System**
- **Parallel Execution:** Managed using `mpi4py` for distributed workloads.
- **Ranks & Roles:** Each process handles a subset of entities.

### **3. Reinforcement Learning (DQN)**
- **Model:** A neural network predicts Q-values based on entity states.
- **Replay Buffer:** Stores experiences for learning.
- **Training Loop:** Optimizes the Q-network to improve decision-making.

### **4. Event Logging & Persistence**
- **Event Logs:** Logs key events (e.g., disasters, discoveries, city expansions).
- **Persistence:** Saves world state, global knowledge, and simulation status.

```

### **Sample Entity State**
```json
{
  "name": "Entity_500",
  "role": "Builder",
  "health": 90,
  "location": [10, -5],
  "resources": {"food": 200, "gold": 150, "influence": 80, "crafted_goods": 10},
  "intelligence": 120,
  "skills": ["Advanced_Combat", "Infrastructure"],
  "local_knowledge": ["electric_power", "steam_engine"],
  "home": "Home_Entity_500",
  "town": "Town_500"
}
```
